 [ImageObserver]
 [ImageCapture]
 [W3AIBO]
 
   - FBK(Filter Bank) Full Band support.
     New luminous images (Y_LH, Y_HL, Y_HH) that are separated by band filters
     can be retrieved from the image sensor in addition to the Y, Cr, and Cb
     images.
     You can reconstruct a double resolution luminous image from the Y, Y_LH,
     Y_HL, and Y_HH images. ImageObserver and W3AIBO can now reconstruct image
     data with double the resolution than previous samples.
     To learn more information about Filter Banks, please read a digital image
     processing textbook.
     
 
 [UDPEchoServer]
 
   - The size of the data echoed back has been changed.
       OLD: fixed size
       NEW: size of received data

 
 [BattChecker]
 
   - Added a new sample program that shows the remaining charge 
     level of AIBO's battery.
     There are three ways that you can use this sample program:  
     with AIBO only, as a simple Win32 program, or as a Win32 
     program with shared memory and MFC.
